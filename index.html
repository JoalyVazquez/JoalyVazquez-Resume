        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a 2022 graduate from North Hollywood High School. I am currently pursuing a Bachelors in Creative Writing, and plan on having Spanish as my second major. I am seeking out an internship as a copywriter or an editorial assistant. Furthermore, I am considering gaining a Masters In Creative Writing. My ultimate goal is to publish a book I have been working on since high school, and publish a book of poems. At the same time I am thinking of making my book into a trilogy. 

Apart from writing, I am investing myself and going back to my passion of making crafts. One of my goals for crafts is to recreate a miniature scale model of Spooky Island from the 2002 movie, Scooby-Doo. My second goal is to recreate the Mystery Machine from Scooby-Doo with all of its details, and have it functioning as a real car. I began my passion with crafts when I was younger. I would try to fix things with the materials I had available. This became a place for me to expand my creativity by tinkering with objects and being an inventor by making crafts. 
<br><br>

        During the pandemic, I got into writing. My family got COVID, and my grandma got it as well making it scarier to imagine the pain I might have to go through if she were to pass on. I needed a place to vent out, and that place would be writing. I never thought writing would become one of my main passions. I was able to vent anything I wanted to without feeling judged by how good the writing was. After a while, I would ask my friends to give their opinion on my piece. Thus, I decided to pursue writing from junior year of high school and beyond. 

At first I wanted to become an animator and work for Warner Bros. or Disney. However, I became frustrated with my own drawing skills. The pandemic gave me an opportunity to express myself with writing. I have directed myself towards writing poetry as my main thing. Although writing is what I am pursuing the most right now, I plan on going back to animation. I want to take my time in drawing and creating a comic which I plan on publishing on the app called WEBTOON.    
<br><br>

        I would describe myself as an organized and energetic hard worker. I strive to do my best in any situation I am placed in. I seek help when I am stuck in my situation rather than trying to stress about figuring it out. I am bilingual in English and Spanish. My passions of writing, drawing, and creating crafts drive me towards achieving my future goals.   

I have been part of programs such as Upward Bound North Hollywood and Big Brother Big Sister of LA. For BBBSLA, I would participate in a bi-weekly mentorship program where I would be paired with ‚Äúbigs‚Äù who would be our mentors that helped me develop academic and personal skills. In Upward Bound, I participated in weekly and monthly academic and personal skill development activities, learned about different opportunities and resources in college, and shaped me into being more confident.
